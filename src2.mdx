## What Differentiates Helicone

Helicone offers two distinctive advantages in the LLM observability space:

### 1. Dual Integration Approaches

Helicone provides flexibility with two integration methods:

- **Proxy integration**: Route requests through Helicone by changing a single URL
- **Async logging**: Capture LLM usage asynchronously without affecting application performance

LangSmith, on the other hand, uses only an async SDK-based approach that requires more code changes and wrapping functions with decorators.

### 2. Cross-Functional Accessibility

Helicone's dashboard is designed so both developers and non-technical team members can understand what's happening:

- See costs and usage at a glance
- Filter and group data easily without writing queries
- Experiment with prompts through a simple interface
- Track real user sessions visually

### 3. Minimal Latency Impact

Despite functioning as a gateway, Helicone minimizes performance impact:

- Edge deployment using Cloudflare Workers for global low-latency
- Only adds approximately 50ms to request times for 95% of global users
- Selected by Cloudflare as one of 29 startups for its Workers Launchpad program

### 4. Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Helicone's infrastructure is built for mission-critical applications:

- 99.9999% uptime over the past few months
- No gateway incidents during this period
- Scalable architecture for handling high traffic volumes

## Helicone: Simple but Powerful

Helicone focuses on making LLM monitoring as painless as possible while still giving you powerful features.

### Key Capabilities

- **Simple setup**: Change one URL and you're logging everything
- **Money-saving caching**: Automatically reuse responses for common requests
- **Custom data tracking**: Add your own metadata to requests for better analysis
- **Session visualization**: See complete user journeys across multiple requests
- **Security tools**: Protect against prompt injection attacks and control spending

### Integration Example

Helicone's proxy integration requires minimal code changes:

```jsx
// Standard OpenAI integration
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY });

// Helicone integration (one URL change + auth header)
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: { "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}` }
});
```

### Dashboard Experience

![Helicone_dashboard](https://ibb.co/JwSZsFh5)

Helicone gives you a clean, intuitive view of your LLM usage:

- See costs broken down by model, feature, and user
- Track how many tokens you're using and how much you're spending
- Measure response times and identify slowdowns
- Find and fix errors quickly with categorized error tracking
- View usage patterns across different regions

What's great is that you don't need to be a data analyst to understand the dashboard. It's designed for everyone on your team, technical or not.

## LangSmith: Workflow Intelligence

LangSmith specializes in tracing complex AI workflows, particularly those built with LangChain. It breaks down each step of your application to help you understand exactly what's happening.

### Key Capabilities

- **Detailed workflow tracing**: See every step your AI application takes
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Test your AI outputs against reference data
- **Seamless LangChain integration**: Perfect if you're already using this ecosystem
- **Structured prompt management**: Keep track of prompt versions and changes
- **Feedback collection**: Gather user feedback on AI responses

### Integration Approach

LangSmith uses an async SDK-based approach. This involves using function decorators to trace your code. For example:

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def process_query(question):
    # Application logic
    return response
```

This method requires more code changes but gives you detailed insights into each function.

### Dashboard Experience

![Langsmith_dashboard](https://ibb.co/zW8jHqSy)

LangSmith organizes everything into:

- **Runs**: Individual operations (like a single LLM call)
- **Threads**: Groups of related operations that fulfill a user request
- **Projects**: Collections of traces for different parts of your application

The interface is more technical than Helicone's but provides deeper visibility into complex workflows.
